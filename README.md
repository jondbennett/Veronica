A wxWidgets program to monitor and configure the Gary Cooper chicken coop controller.

The description says it all. It monitors the telemetry radio from the Gary Cooper Arduino chicken coop controller and provides voice updates whenever something changes.
It also provides the opportunity to change the settings as the current Gary Cooper implementation has no physical user interface.
